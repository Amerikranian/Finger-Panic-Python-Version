Welcome to finger panic! A free game from BSC GAMES rewritten by MTG Studios! We are certain you will be hooked after playing it one time!  The name says it all! Simple to play but extremely addictive! You are on a 4 by 4 grid and on the game grid is only 1 crackerjack! You have to find that one crackerjack by using your up/down/left/right arrow keys. Sounds simple, right? 

once you launch the game, you are in the main menu. click start game to begin!
Or, you can click exit to just forget about it all.
After you find the one crackerjack, another one is immediately plopped on the game grid in a random spot. Simply arrow and find it. This repeats over and over and is the whole point of the game. As you gather crackerjacks and proceed further in the game, you have less time to stumble across the crackerjack!

You can run, but it's extremely buggy and you lose points for it.
If you are running, and you get a cracker jack, you get 25 points less
to pause, hit p, and to unpause, hit U.
Every 10 crackerjacks you gather, you will hear a bell ding. This is letting you know that now you have less time to locate the crackerjack so hurry!! How far can you get?
once you finish a game, a stats menu pops up. you can either look through and copy your stats, or just click escape or done to close it.
